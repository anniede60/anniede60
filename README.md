# A Bit About Me
I am just starting a Masters, in Bioinformatics, at the grand old age of almost 60. This is after completing an BSc Honors Combined STEM degree, with the Open University, in July 2023. My combined areas were, Biomedical, Computing and Statistics.

GitHub is all new territory for me, but lucky for me I have several members of my family that are dab hands at it and I can give a closeup and personal tour and help using it. :grin:
